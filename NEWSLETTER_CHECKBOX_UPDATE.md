# Newsletter Form - Opt-In Checkbox Update

## Changes Made

Added a required opt-in checkbox to the newsletter form for explicit user consent.

### Updated File
`components/newsletter-form.tsx`

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Checkbox Input
- **Required field** with red asterisk indicator
- **Unchecked by default** (explicit opt-in)
- Styled with brand color (#B3FF00)
- Accessible with proper label association

### ✅ Form Validation
- Submit button **disabled** until checkbox is checked
- Client-side validation with error message
- Checkbox state resets after successful submission

### ✅ GDPR Compliance
- **Explicit consent language**: "I agree to receive email notifications..."
- Clearly states what user will receive (court bookings, events, tips, offers)
- Identifies the sender (The Dink House)
- Required field (no pre-checked boxes)

### ✅ User Experience
- Checkbox and label are clickable
- Visual feedback on hover/focus
- Maintains brand styling (#B3FF00 accent color)
- Responsive layout (stacks on mobile)
- Shows error if user tries to submit without checking

## UI Layout

**Before:**
```
[Email Input] [Subscribe Button]
```

**After:**
```
[Email Input] [Subscribe Button]
[☐] I agree to receive email notifications... *
```

## Form Behavior

1. **Initial State:**
   - Checkbox: unchecked
   - Submit button: disabled (grayed out)

2. **User checks checkbox:**
   - Submit button: enabled

3. **User unchecks checkbox:**
   - Submit button: disabled again

4. **User tries to submit without checking:**
   - Error message: "Please confirm that you want to receive notifications."

5. **Successful submission:**
   - Email field cleared
   - Checkbox reset to unchecked
   - Success message shown

## Code Changes

### State Management
```typescript
const [acceptNotifications, setAcceptNotifications] = useState(false);
```

### Validation
```typescript
if (!acceptNotifications) {
  setMessage({
    type: "error",
    text: "Please confirm that you want to receive notifications.",
  });
  return;
}
```

### Submit Button
```typescript
disabled={loading || !acceptNotifications}
```

### Checkbox Component
```tsx
<div className="flex items-start gap-3">
  <input
    required
    checked={acceptNotifications}
    className="mt-1 w-5 h-5 border-2 border-gray-300 rounded focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#B3FF00] accent-[#B3FF00] cursor-pointer"
    disabled={loading}
    id="accept-notifications"
    type="checkbox"
    onChange={(e) => setAcceptNotifications(e.target.checked)}
  />
  <label
    className="text-sm text-gray-700 cursor-pointer select-none"
    htmlFor="accept-notifications"
  >
    I agree to receive email notifications about court bookings, events,
    tips, and special offers from The Dink House.{" "}
    <span className="text-red-500">*</span>
  </label>
</div>
```
